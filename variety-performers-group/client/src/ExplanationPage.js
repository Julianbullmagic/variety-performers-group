<h1>How does Democracy Book Work?</h1>
<p>
This socialistic social network is guided by the principle that if something is relevant to you and you have the
expertise to understand it, you should be directly involved in making decisions about it. Authority should be grounded
in wisdom, knowledge and moral integrity instead of coercive, exploitative power. People's ability to
participate should be independent of how wealthy they are and we should ban capitalist exploitation.

There are two main types of groups. All users are a part of one large democratic group but can also join specific groups
for particular subjects.
The main group composed of everyone of Democracy Book is subdivided up into smaller groups that are federated or linked
together, all are roughly 40 people in size. At the top level, level 0, are local groups
composed of roughly 40 people or less. We put you with people who live closest to your location.
For roughly each four of these local groups there is a lower level group that represents them both. This group is
composed of roughly 20 people chosen at random from the 160 members of the local groups above and 20 elected by the upper
groups. For each four of these higher level groups there is an even lower representative group composed of 20 people chosen
at random from the top 640 users and 20 elected by them. This pattern of linking or "federating" groups together
repeats until all members are linked together. Level one groups represent 160 people, level two groups
represent 640 people, level three represents 2560, level four 10240 and so on. Lower level groups cannot impose
onto the groups above them, but they can make proposals. They can suggest rules and events to be approved by referendum.
Local groups can also make their own rules and events. You can click to vote on any rule or event in a group you are a member
 of. In lower level groups if a rule or event does not receive the approval of the majority of representatives in that group
 it is deleted. If it does get more than 50% approval, it is passed up to the local groups for a referendum and all relevant
 members can vote. If it doesn't get more than 50% approval after one month, the event or rule is deleted.

 Users can visit and watch all groups in democracy book but you can propose rules or events or write posts in lower level groups
 unless you are chosen to be a representative. All users will at some time be chosen and everyone has an equal opportunity.
 Half of these representatives are chosen at random because this ensures a good mix of all demographic groups. By this I
 mean there will be a proportionate number of men and women (50:50), a proportionate number of Asian, African, Young, Elderly,
 Indigenous and so on. The other half of representatives are elected. Users can vote to give or withdraw approval from a
 candidate at any time. They can also propose a candidate at any time. This gives elected representatives a greater
 incentive to consult with and discuss with the people they represent, if they don't do what the people want, or lead them
 in a direction that is in the best interests of the group, they can have their authority revoked. Ideally, all members of Democracy
 Book will have a high level of political and social conscious and even the randomly chosen representatives will just voluntarily
 try their best to also lead the whole group in a direction that is their best interests.

Users can also join groups for particular subjects or issues. These are subdivided and linked in the same way as all the local groups

The subdivided groups are relatively small, roughly 40 people. This means that all members can participate in discussion and we can
have more in depth conversations and discussions in order to reach the most informed decisions. We are trying to create deliberative democracy.
